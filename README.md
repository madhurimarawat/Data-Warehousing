## Directory Structure 📂

- **Codes** 💻 (If applicable)  
  Contains code files used for the data processing and analysis in each experiment. These files are critical for performing the tasks required in the experiment.
  - e.g., `main.py`, `process_data.py`

- **Documentation** 📝  
  This folder contains detailed documentation for each experiment, including methodology, analysis, and insights. Documentation is provided in both Markdown (`.md`) and PDF formats for easy reference.
  - `documentation.md` (Markdown version of the documentation)
  - `documentation.pdf` (PDF version of the documentation)

- **Dataset** 📁 (If applicable)  
  Contains the datasets used for analysis in each experiment. Datasets are placed here to ensure easy access and organization.
  - e.g., `data.csv`, `stream_data.json`

- **Output** 📊  
  Stores the output generated from each experiment, including visualizations, data analysis results, and any other relevant outputs.
  - `Experiment X Output` (where "X" refers to the relevant experiment number)

### Explanation of Folders:

- **Codes Folder (💻):**  
  Contains the source code used for the experiment. If the experiment involves running scripts or programs, the corresponding code files go here.

- **Dataset Folder (📁):**  
  This folder stores the dataset used in an experiment. If a dataset is involved (like a `.csv`, `.json`, or any data file), it will be placed here.

- **Output Folder (📊):**  
  Stores the outputs/results generated by the experiments. This might include processed data, logs, or result files. Each experiment’s output is stored separately with a relevant name.

- **Documentation Folder (📝):**  
  Contains the documentation of each experiment, provided in both `.md` and `.pdf` formats. The Markdown file is converted to PDF using the provided link for Markdown to PDF conversion.

- **Commands File (📋):**  
  A text file documenting the specific commands or steps used in the experiment, especially useful for command-line operations.
