### **Project Folder Structure**  

- **Codes** 💻 (If applicable)  
Contains the source code files used for data processing and analysis in each experiment. These scripts are essential for executing tasks within the experiment. Additionally, the following files are included:
  - **MySQL Commands and Output (TXT)**: This text file contains the specific MySQL command-line operations used in the experiment, documenting both the input commands and their corresponding outputs. A detailed explanation of these commands and their results can be found in the **Documentation** folder, available in both **MD** and **PDF** formats.

- **Dataset** 📁 (If applicable)  
  Stores datasets used in experiments, ensuring easy access and organization.  
  - e.g., `data.csv`, `stream_data.json`  

- **Output** 📊  
  Stores results generated from experiments, including visualizations, processed data, logs, and analysis reports. Each experiment's output is stored separately with a relevant name.  
  - e.g., `Experiment_X_Output` (where "X" refers to the relevant experiment number)  

- **Documentation** 📝  
  Contains detailed documentation for each experiment, covering methodology, analysis, and insights. Documentation is provided in both Markdown (`.md`) and PDF formats for easy reference.  
  - `documentation.md` (Markdown version)  
  - `documentation.pdf` (PDF version, converted from Markdown)  

- **Commands File (📋)**  
  A text file stored in the **Codes** folder, documenting specific commands, steps, and MySQL output used in the experiment. This is especially useful for tracking command-line operations and database interactions.  
  - `MySQL_Commands_Output.txt`
