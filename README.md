### **Project Folder Structure**  

- **Codes** 💻 (If applicable)  
  Contains source code files used for data processing and analysis in each experiment. These scripts are essential for executing tasks within the experiment. Additionally, this folder includes a **MySQL Commands and Output** text file that documents specific command-line operations and their results.  
  - e.g., `main.py`, `process_data.py`, `MySQL_Commands_Output.txt`  

- **Dataset** 📁 (If applicable)  
  Stores datasets used in experiments, ensuring easy access and organization.  
  - e.g., `data.csv`, `stream_data.json`  

- **Output** 📊  
  Stores results generated from experiments, including visualizations, processed data, logs, and analysis reports. Each experiment's output is stored separately with a relevant name.  
  - e.g., `Experiment_X_Output` (where "X" refers to the relevant experiment number)  

- **Documentation** 📝  
  Contains detailed documentation for each experiment, covering methodology, analysis, and insights. Documentation is provided in both Markdown (`.md`) and PDF formats for easy reference.  
  - `documentation.md` (Markdown version)  
  - `documentation.pdf` (PDF version, converted from Markdown)  

- **Commands File (📋)**  
  A text file stored in the **Codes** folder, documenting specific commands, steps, and MySQL output used in the experiment. This is especially useful for tracking command-line operations and database interactions.  
  - `MySQL_Commands_Output.txt`

## Table Of Contents 📔 🔖 📑

### 1. [Introduction to Data Warehousing Concepts](https://github.com/madhurimarawat/Data-Warehousing/tree/main/Experiment%201)

This experiment introduces the fundamental concepts and architecture of data warehousing, including ETL processes, data modeling techniques, and OLAP functionalities.  

### 2. [Creating Star Schema in Data Warehouse](https://github.com/madhurimarawat/Data-Warehousing/tree/main/Experiment%202)

This experiment focuses on designing and implementing a star schema data model for a specified business scenario, emphasizing the creation of fact and dimension tables. 

### 3. [Implementing Snowflake Schema in Data Warehouse](https://github.com/madhurimarawat/Data-Warehousing/tree/main/Experiment%203)

In this experiment, the Snowflake Schema was implemented to achieve a more 
normalized data structure than the Star Schema.  

### 4. [Designing ETL Process for Data Warehousing](https://github.com/madhurimarawat/Data-Warehousing/tree/main/Experiment%204)

In this experiment, an ETL process was designed and implemented to migrate 
data from operational databases to a data warehouse.
